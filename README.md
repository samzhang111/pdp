## About

This work was developed with the support of a [US Research Software Sustainability Institute](https://urssi.us/) early-career fellowship.
Thanks to helpful discussions with Patrick Ball, Tarak Shah, Bailey Passmore, and Ayyub Ibrahim, and many conversations about PDP with Daniel Manrique-Vallier.
Principled Data Processing was a framework developed by the [Human Rights Data Analysis Group](https://hrdag.org) in the early 2000s, to facilitate reproducibility in their forensic human rights work.
Incidentally, I've come to think it's one of the better ways of organizing data analysis projects in general.
